    <p class="mainbodytext1">Introduction</p>
		<p class="mainbodytext2">A popular area of research in developmental biology is how and by what mechanisms a sperm fertilizes an egg. Evolution has provided species cells with the ability to attract and locate one another to reproduce. Due to the challenging environment male sex cells face, a significant number of them must be produced. However, this high number of sperm generates a different challenge for the female sex cells: polyspermy. Polyspermy is defined by more than one sperm fusing with an egg (Just E, 1912). It results in extra mitotic spindles fibers forming and inconsistent segregation of chromosomes into four poles during cell divisions. This results in the formation of non-diploid cells which arrests development.
When viewed at a microscopic level, the binding of many sperm to the egg can be seen (Alberts et al, 2002). However, because development occurs, it is obvious that only one sperm is allowed to enter as polyspermy stops cleavages. Therefore, the motivation behind this study was to determine how polyspermy is blocked at fertilization.</p>

	<div id="mainbodybox2">
	    <p class="mainbodytext11">Rationale</p>
			<p class="mainbodytext21"> In 1909, Harvey provided evidence of what is now known as the slow block to polyspermy in sea urchins. He described how after the addition of sperm to an egg, the membrane substances become separated from the egg surface by a fluid filled space. However, he indicated that this takes between one and three minutes to occur. Thus, if this block was a singular mechanism, most sea urchins would experience polyspermy. As stated previously, species have the ability to attract reproductive cells. Sea urchin eggs supply sperm activating peptides (SAPS) into the surrounding environment of the ocean (Summers and Hylander, 1975) to induce fertilization. SAPS are highly alluring to sperm, thus, the egg often has numerous sperm bound to it before the slow block Harvey describes is activated. Therefore, it was hypothesized that there must be a secondary, fast block to polyspermy in sea urchins that allows time for the membrane to become separated from the egg.
The work of Gray (1922) was the first to suggest that an electrical mechanism may be responsible for this fast block to polyspermy. While working as a graduate student in 1976, Laurinda A. Jaffe was able to demonstrate this. She provided evidence that membrane depolarization or “fertilization potential” is a fast block to polyspermy in sea urchins.

	    <p class="maintitletext2">Main Findings</p>
			<p class="maintitletext2">Previous works proved that the cortical reaction occurs after a single sperm encounters the egg (Anderson, 1968). This blocks the entry of any additional sperm. However, the process takes approximately a minute to be completed within sea urchins. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a secondary block to polyspermy must exist. Written by Jaffe in 1976, “Fast block to polyspermy in sea urchins is electrically mediated” provides evidence of such. The experimentation conducted demonstrates that electrical depolarization seen during fertilization constitutes a fast block to polyspermy resulting from the regenerative response of the egg membrane. The discoveries made can be grouped into five main things: the resting membrane potential in a unfertilized sea urchin egg is -70mV, the egg depolarizes to approximately +15mV at insemination, this state is maintained for one minute until the cortical reaction occurs, the egg then repolarizes to -70mV and eggs that at -10mV become polyspermic whereas fertilization will not occur if +15mV.  </p>
	  </div>

		<div id="mainbodybox3">
		    <p class="mainbodytext11">Positive Action Potential</p>
				<p class="mainbodytext21">The research suggests that the entry of additional sperm will be prevented by a more positive action potential (Figure 1). This was demonstrated by adjusting the action potentials within the eggs using voltage mediated clamps. The voltage plateaus that measured less than -10mV were often polyspermic, whereas, if more positive than 0 mV, polyspermy never occurred. This can be seen in figure 1. Additionally, if action potential was too elevated (> +5mV) no fertilization occurred. Therefore, according to Jaffe (1976), over-fertilization occurs when the action potential is less than -10mV and does not occur when greater than +5mV.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div id="mainbodybox4">
	    <p class="mainbodytext1">Initiation of Action Potential</p>
			<p class="mainbodytext2"> The study also evinces that the rise in action potential is initiated by sperm fusion but completed by the egg membrane. When the sperm fuses with the vitellin envelope, it causes the egg to depolarize to -30mV to -20mV. As a consequence, the egg then has the capacity to produce a regenerative response, amplifying the depolarization. The regenerative response is similar to the excitability of a calcium spike seen in muscle cells, yet the sea urchin egg uses sodium. This brings the egg membrane potential to a level which refuses further entry of sperm. To show this, Jaffe and colleagues conducted a series of small depolarising current pluses before and after eggs were inseminated. This can be seen in Figure 2. Eggs with sperm demonstrated a less positive action potential in comparison to those without. Additionally, this investigation demonstrated that rise of action potential occurs within three seconds of fertilization, and only lasts until after the cortical response occurs.

		<p class="mainbodytext1">Polyspermy is Batch Dependant</p>
		<p class="mainbodytext2">This study also observed that when the monitored egg was polyspermic, the other eggs in the same dish were also polyspermic. This led Jaffe to conclude that the lack of fast block polyspermy is a property of a “batch” of eggs. Therefore, if unable to block polyspermy it is a fault of egg deterioration.

		<p class="mainbodytext11">How Does the Fast Block Work?</p>
		<p class="mainbodytext21">This short publishing was just the beginning of Jaffe’s discoveries. She continued her work by publishing a paper titled “Electrical Regulation of Sperm-Egg Fusion” (Jaffe and Cross, 1986) where the cellular mechanisms of how the fast block in sea urchins works is described. The egg has sperm receptors and sodium channels in the plasma membrane. Sodium channels remain closed until a sperm has bound. When opened, an influx of sodium enters the egg due to the differential potential. The inside of the cell is then more positive when compared to the outside. This does not allow for the fusion of any additional sperm. Jaffe has continued this work in other species such as frogs whose mechanisms remain similar, but are additionally complex and require other ions.

	<p class="maintitletext2">Signifigance</p>
	<p class="maintitletext2">This study by Jaffe has had important contributions in the realm of developmental biology. Primarily, it was important to understand the workings of sea urchin development as they are used as a model organism due to their accessibility, rapid synchronous development, amenability to experimental manipulation and their optical transparency (McClay, 2011). It was comprehensive as it was developed at a time when sperm-egg fusion was thought to occur at the end of the latent period (McCulloh and Chambers, 1992). This has come to be as known as incorrect as if it were the case, how could the first sperm fuse to the egg? Future studies focused on if this mechanism of polyspermy was applicable to other species. Many specifically investigated mammals and if there was a potential for clinical use. This research also prompted many new questions regarding fertilization. Furthermore, this electrophysiological change reiterated that fertilization that precedes and causes egg activation had not fully been elucidate. Thus, Jaffe’s 1976 experiments on the fast block to polyspermy inspired studies regarding gamete membrane fusion, sperm entry, the sequence of the increase in egg’s membrane conductance, and the casual correlation between these events (McCulloh and Chambers, 1992). In more recent years, this paper is also referenced in studies that discuss cell signalling and signal transduction pathways. Interestingly, the research can even be related to microbiology in the realm of virus (Covid-19) membrane fusion.

		<p class="mainbodytext11">Fast Block Does Not Exist in Mammals</p>
		<p class="mainbodytext21">It was indicated that a polyspermic block exists as only 1.2% of mouse eggs were polyspermic, whereas 17.4% of eggs had two or more sperm pass through the zona pellucisa (Braden et al, 1954). Previous studies had determined that this occurs through mechanisms such as: the restriction of number of sperm that reach the egg, a block at the zona pellucida, a block at the egg plasma membrane and elimination of polyspermy from the egg cytoplasm. However, based upon her previous studies in the sea urchin, Jaffe set out to discover if an electrical block also existed in mice (1982).  To determine if there was a shift in mouse membrane potential at the time of fertilization, Jaffe and colleagues recorded potential before, during and after insemination. They determined that there was no significant change in the membrane potential within 1 hour after fertilization (excluding oscillation), yet during this time, the block to polyspermy had already been established. Though membrane potential remains constant, it was observed that membrane resistance decreases. Thus, fertilization in mammals also increase ionic permeability of the egg membrane in mammals. To independently ensure that mice do not have an electrical block to polyspermy, Jaffe altered concentrations of sodium and calcium in in-vitro mediums. Results supported this as reduction of these ions does not increase fertilization. Therefore, these tests along with other studies (Austin and Braden, 1956; Braden et al., 1954) conclude that the previously mentioned blocks are sufficient in mammals, and no fast block exists.

		<p class="mainbodytext1">The Sperm is Responsible for Fast Block</p>
		<p class="mainbodytext2">The paper by McCulloh and Chambers (1922) was inspired by the work of Jaffe and colleagues. It provides evidence that sperm-egg membrane fusion occurs at their initial contact and that the fertilizing sperm is responsible for the fast block to polyspermy. Their research allows electrical potential to be considered the earliest sign of successful contact between gametes. The establishment of electrical continuity assures fusion is initiated before the achievement of the positive membrane potential that preludes polyspermy. The research emphasises that sperm membranes are the site of voltage sensor (Jaffe et al, 1982) and they have channels which initiate the depolarization of the egg’s membrane. This provides a fail-safe mechanism to avoid an unfertilized egg.
</p>
<p class="mainbodytext1">What is Next?</p>
<p class="mainbodytext2">Jaffe’s work on electrically mediated blocks in sea urchins quickly expanded both in species and in depth. A recent work titled “The TMEM16A channel mediates the fast polyspermy block in Xenopus laevis” (Wozniak et al, 2015) discusses how though some species have fast block to polyspermy, they differ in their mechanisms. Frogs use calcium-mediated channels allow chloride permeability to flow into their environment. This is to say that this topic of research is important as it is ever growing and expanding. It is the hope to better understand the mechanisms of fertilization in these model species to learn more about the biological world. </p>
