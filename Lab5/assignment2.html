    <h2 class="header2class"> What is Taylor's Version?</h2>
    <p>
   The Taylor's Version albums, instigated by music manager Scooter Braun's
    sale of her early catalog, represent Swift's effort to control her own
    songs and how they're used — a fitting ethos for “Speak Now,” a record
    built exclusively of her own voice.
