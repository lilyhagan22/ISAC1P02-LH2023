    <p class="regionpurposetext1">What Does the Cerebellum Do?</p>
      <p class="regionpurposetext2">This area of the brain is responsible for muscle control. This includes things such as balance and movement.
			It contributes to quick response times and hand-eye coordination. Increased size of a cerebellum may lead to improvement of these fine motor skills. </p>

		<p class="regionpurposetext5">Basketball is my favourite sport. I played both on a club team and on my high school team. My club team consisted of other girls who attened a different high school (SF). When we (SJ) played against SF during the school season, it was very interesting. Despite SF having more of our club players, SJ came out victorous every year. Not to brag or anything (I'm definitely bragging)... but I never lost a championship, I was starting the pointgaurd and won MVP! Currently, I play intramurals here at Brock. I needed to practice my skills for the alumni game at which is coming up at my high school! </p>

		<p class="regionpurposetext4">I have payed soccer every summer since I was 4. This began when my parents put me in the TimBits league. This was the first time I had ever played a sport and I found that I enjoyed competition as well as the team aspect it required. The images to the left display my team the year I was in grade 9. We had just won EOSSA! I was the goalie and had saved a penalty shot within the last 2 minutes of the finals to win!</p>
