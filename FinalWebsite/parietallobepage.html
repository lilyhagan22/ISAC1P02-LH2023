    <p class="regionpurposetext1">What Does the Parietal Lobe Do?</p>
      <p class="regionpurposetext2">The parietal lobes main function is to receieve sensory information and interpret it.
      It specifically does this with touch and vision. It is the region of the brain that creates perception of body awareness and constructs the
      spatial coordinate system (a mental map) that respresents the world around us. It also plays a role in number recognition and
      relationships - specifically calendars: dates and time. This lobe assigns significances to these numbers. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="texturebox">
    <p class="texturestext1">Textures</p>
    <p class="texturestext2">Texture combines multiple senses as it is the feel, appearance and consistancy of an object. This contributes to much of individuals likes and dislikes. For example, texture and food. Sure there are some things that look, smell and taste good, but due to the texture I will not eat it. Some examples:</p>
    <ul class="texturestext2">
      <li>Raspberries (why do they have hairs!?)</li>
      <li>Pea soup</li>
      <li>Boiled eggs (specifically the yolk)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="texturestext2"> Another example is texture and fabrics. We want things to feel nice to the touch, but often the visual aesthetic of a fabic is equally as important - quite possibly the reason decorative pillows exsist haha.

  <div id="mybirthdaybox">
    <p class="mybirthdaytext1">My Birthday</p>
    <p class="mybirthdaytext2">My birthday is September 22, 2003. My brothers birthday is January 22, 2006. Because of this, the number 22 has always been significant to me. I like that its even, divisable, and that it is monodigit - great characteristics of a number in my opinion. The significance has caused me to display it everywhere. My jersey numbers, in usernames and it is going to be my next tattoo! </p>
  </div>

  <div id="yourbirthdaybox">
    <p class="yourbdaytext1">Do the last two numbers in this sequence significance to you?</p>

    <p class="yourbdaytext1">Visual Interpertation</p>
      <span class="yourbdaytext3"> Every persons parietal lobe processes senses differently meaning what stimuli is attarctive is unique.
      This creates diversity in human design. I grew up watching HGTV with my mom, and discovered my favourite home design style is 70's Boho. I like he mix of traditional elements
      with diverse colour and textures!<p>

  <div id="funfactbox">
    <p class="mybirthdaytext1">Funfact!</p>
    <p class="mybirthdaytext2">Ever wonder why in careers in urban planning, architrcture and construction are dominated by men? Well, a possible reason for this is that males experience superior spatial ability when compared to women. This is due to men having a larger parietal lobe! </p>
