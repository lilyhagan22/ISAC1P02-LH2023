    <p class="regionpurposetext1">What Does the Brainstem Do?</p>
      <p class="regionpurposetext2">The brainstem is located at the base of the brain,
			near the spine. Because of its location, it has quick and easy access to the rest
		  of the body and therefore, is perfect for controlling involuntary responses. These
		  include things such as regulating our heartbeat, breathing and response to injury
		  (ex. pulling your hand away from a hot surface - quick response insures minimal damage). </p>

		<p class="medscitext1">My Studies in Medicine and Future Plans</p>
		<p class="medscitext2"> In high school I worked at at vet cinic, and after hours one day I had the oppertunity to help with a c-section! We
		delivered 12 puppies, and all I could think was "What if this (delivering babies) was my job?" Since then my career goal has been an obstetrician/gynecologist.
	  For this reason, I am currently in the medical sciences program and will be writing the MCAT this summer (eek!).</p>
