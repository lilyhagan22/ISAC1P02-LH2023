		<p class="regionpurposetext1">What Does the Fontal Lobe Do?</p>
			<p class="regionpurposetext2">The frontal lobe has a variety of functions that
				overall work to achieve goals. In terms of behaviour, it acknowledges and
				suppresses what is considered socially inappropriate, can predict the consequences
				of action and makes choices between bad and good actions. This region also plays
				a role in problem solving, speech production (speaking), and motor control â€“
				specifically voluntary movements.</p>

		<p class="duolingotext1">Speech Production: Duo Lingo</p>
			<p class="duolingotext2"> Next semester during reading week I am going on a trip
			to Paris France! Though I took 5 years of French Immersion in elementary school...
			I cannot speak French. The one sentance that has stuck with me is "Est que je peux aller au toilet?", and indicator of my attention (haha).
			Langauges have never been my stong suit, but I want to learn the basics before my travels.
			For this reason I have been using the app Duolingo! Their research shows that learners in ther French course
			are able to roduce complete sentences, remember words quickly, and speak comfortably about everyday topics at a conversational pace.
			My current streak is 44 days!

			<p class="gymtext2"> Last Janurary, I had that stereotypical new years resolution to start going to the gym... and I actually stuck to it!
			I have become what would some would call a "gym rat," as I tend to spend around two hours working out six times a week. I rotate between three days.

				<li>Chest and Triceps</li>
				<li>Legs</li>

		<p class="gymtext2">Working is good for my physical health, but I have found it is great for my mental health.
