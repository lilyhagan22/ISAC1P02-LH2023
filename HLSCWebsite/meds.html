    <p class="nameboxtitle">John Archer</p>
    <p class="nameboxtext"> After improving both my diet and exercise, I returned to the doctor.
      He congratulationed me on my hard work, but informed me that my glucose levels had not
      decreased to a level he was comfortable with. For this reason he recommended that I start taking Metformin. He explained to me that it works for prediabetes
      by lowering the amount of glucose absorbed and made by the body. It also makes the body more sensitive to its natural insulin.

    <p class="nameboxtitle">Eloise Tuntford</p>
  <p class="nameboxtext"> After both my diet and exercise, I returned to the doctor. She told me that my glucose levels had not come down enough.
    She informed me that she would prescribe a drug called Metformin. I do not know what it does, or how it works and I try not to take medications
    as I become frightened at the long list of side effects. Maybe I should just stick to eating better and going for longer walks...
