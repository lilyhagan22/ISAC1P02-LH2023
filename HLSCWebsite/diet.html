    <p class="nameboxtext"> The doctor told me I need to lower my blood glucose. He said
      that I should start with a diet. With the stress of people counting on me
      both a work and at home I have been stressed out a lot lately, and maybe...
      possible... slightly be eating one too many candy bars to compensate. This
      is something that I could work on. My job provides benefits that contribute
      to weightloss programs. Also Lana has been asking me to take her to Farmboy
      one day too... Maybe that would help. </p>

  <p class="nameboxtext"> The doctor told me I need to lower my blood glucose. She said
    that I should start with a diet. I normally do my shooping at walmart so that I can
    grab everything I need at once. However, the fresh produce selection never looks apatizing
    so I avoid purchasing it.  
    in dieting. </p>

    <p class="nameboxtext"> The doctor told me my blood glucose is too high. He said
      that I should start with a diet. Being a single mom, taking care of my mom, working
      full time and trying to deal with the grief of losing husband all at the same time
      doesn't leave me woth much time to think about my diet. I'm on my feet from the time I
      get up in the morning until I go to bed at night and eat what I can when I can. </p>
