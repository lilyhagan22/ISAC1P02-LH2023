    <p class="nameboxtitle">John Archer</p>
    <p class="nameboxtext"> The doctor told me I need to lower my blood glucose. He said
      that I should start with a diet. With the number of people counting on me
      both a work and at home, I have been stressed out a lot lately, and may have possibly been
      eating one too many candy bars to compensate. This
      is something that I could work on. My job also provides me with benefits that contribute
      to weightloss programs and Lana has been asking me to take her to Farmboy lately. Maybe these could help me diet. </p>
    <p class="nameboxtitle">What will John do?</p>

    <p class="nameboxtitle">Koda Algernop</p>
    <p class="nameboxtext"> The doctor told me my blood glucose is too high. She said
      that I should start with a diet. Because I am a emergency mechanic, I am often
      on the road at all times of day, either going to help someone who is stuck or to pick up needed parts.
      Because of this I keep dollar store snacks in my truck and often resort to getting fast food. I suppose
      I could choose to purchase healtheir items, but they are more expensive and we are on a budget. </p>
    <p class="nameboxtitle"> What will Koda do?</p>
    <ol class="nameboxtext">
      <li> <a href="exercise.html">Buy the healthier, more expensive snacks/fastfood</a> </li>

    <p class="nameboxtitle">Eloise Tuntford</p>
  <p class="nameboxtext"> The doctor told me I need to lower my blood glucose. She said
    that I should start with a diet. I normally do my shopping at Walmart so that I can
    grab everything I need at once. However, the fresh produce selection never looks appetizing
    so I avoid purchasing it. There is a farmers market near my house on Saturday mornings...
    maybe if I make the effort to go, they will have better quailty vegetables. At school,
    I also just quickly grab lunch from the cafeteria so I can get my marking done and go home
    early. If I packed a lunch and took my break, that could help me diet. </p>
  <p class="nameboxtitle"> What will Eloise do?</p>

    <li> <a href="exercise.html">Pack a lunch and shop at the farmers market</a> </li>

    <p class="nameboxtitle">Naomi Kane</p>
    <p class="nameboxtext"> The doctor told me my blood glucose is too high. He said
      that I should start with a diet. Being a single mom, taking care of my mom, working
      full time and trying to deal with the grief of losing husband all at the same time
      doesn't leave me with much time to think about my diet or to pick up extra shifts at work. I'm on my feet from the time I
      get up in the morning until I go to bed at night and eat what I can when I can. Theoretically I could choose to purchase healither food
      but as I live in a single income home and am paid minimum wage cannot afford it.</p>
