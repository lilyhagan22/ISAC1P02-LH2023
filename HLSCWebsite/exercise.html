    <p class="nameboxtitle">John Archer</p>
    <p class="nameboxtext"> After improving my diet, I returned to the doctor who let me know I was doing better, but that I needed to keep working on lowering my blood glucose levels. He said
      that I should continue my progress by exercising. The hospital that I work at has a free staff gym. Instead of leaving if my surgery ends early (which happens about twice a week),
      I could stay and workout. On Sundays Lana goes to Zumba at this fitness center just down the street from my house. Maybe I should ask her if I can come along. I am sure
      my mother would love an excuse to babysit the kids. </p>

  <div id="kodabox">
    <p class="nameboxtitle">Koda Algernop</p>
    <p class="nameboxtext"> After improving my diet, I returned to the doctor told me my blood glucose is still too high. She said
      that I needed to start exercising right now. I do not think that she understands my situation. I want to be healthy,
      but it is hard for me to find the time to workout. My routine is all over the place due to my work schedule, and I typically
      need to sleep during the day. My neighbourhood isn't the safest and I do not feel comfortable walking at night. I thought about going to
      the gym, but eating healthier has increased what we spend on food so I cannot afford a membership. Plus, I wouldn't know how to begin working out.</p>

  <p class="nameboxtext"> After improving my diet, I returned to the doctor and she told me I still need to lower my blood glucose. She said
    that I should try exercising. There are lots of hiking trails in the area, and I do like walking...
    but the weather is starting to get cold outside. The Brock University gym has an indoor track. Maybe
    I should think about getting a membership.
